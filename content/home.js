        Every line of code here was written by myself. I had no experience writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript prior 
        to June of 2019, but have honestly grown to enjoy those languages and their possibilities. Of course, that doesn't 
        mean that I started programming then. I've had a long history with computers which is described in my Bio page.
